<h1> 301 Journal Day Eleven</h1>

We learned about page.js and how it can be used to enhance a single page web app.

 We also learned how we can save the state of our browsing history so that we can retrieve that information again without having to query the server for the same information. 

I'm intrigued at the possibilities of this because i want to see if it is possible to display this info on a page as clickable links to choose a particular state that was saved in history as opposed to using the browsers' drop-down history bar. Maybe a snapshot??
