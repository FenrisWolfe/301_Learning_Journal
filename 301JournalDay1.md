Day one,
A most confusing day indeed, however I would say it was a cool learning experience.  
Learned how to start a browser that will respond to whatever size it is displayed on.
Instructor went over the gitHub flow but I pretty much phased out after the second sentence.  
Also went over SMACSS, AGILE and various other practices.
