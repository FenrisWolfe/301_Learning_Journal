<h1># LJ Code 301 - Day 1</h1>


Day one,
A most confusing day indeed, however I would say it was a cool learning experience.  
Learned how to start a browser that will respond to whatever size it is displayed on.
Instructor went over the gitHub flow but I pretty much phased out after the second sentence.  
Also went over SMACSS, AGILE and various other practices.

During code pairing we messed up the flow. Will not let happen next time.
