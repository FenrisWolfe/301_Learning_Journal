<h1> 301 Journal Day Thirteen</h1>

This was a very COOL AS HELL lecture!!


We learned about a developing structure in that we do our work on a stage and use that to push changes to a master or PRODUCTION platform.  (although some DEVS don't run that way)
We learned how hot-fixes can be a good thing but can also potentially create a disaster if that hot-fix isn't communicated properly among the developers working on the same product.

We also learned about HEROKU ad how to deploy a web product via HEROKU utilizing gitHub.  It looked like a complicated learning curve, but it actually works simplistically. I noticed the biggest stumbling blocks to be SYNTAX in that one wrong letter or missing semi-colon can make a developers life hell.  The great thing about that though is the use of the HEROKU logs that you can look through and find where the errors are occurring.

I look forward to using this and learning SASS in he next lecture!
