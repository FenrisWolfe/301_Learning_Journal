<h1># LJ Code 301 - Day 6</h1>

Day six we learned about the underlying concepts of how the web works and associated terms.

we were introduced to the WRRC or Web Request Response Cycle, as in how the web responds to certain actions in or by the browser while surfing a website or the internet.

We learned about the 3 parts of requests such as URL, method headers and the responses like, Status, Headers and the body and using the live server. (which I like to use while developing my Portfolio site).

We discussed AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript And Xml) which is a client-side script that helps with communication to and from a server to refresh ONLY what needs refreshing on a page instead of refreshing the WHOLE page.
